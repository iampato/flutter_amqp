# flutter_amqp

A new Flutter project.

## Why this project
Flutter AMQP, so why create a new one, I need to use AMQP but must have the heartbeat feature that the dart version lacks and native libraries already have this feature

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
